# Annette's Personal Portfolio Website

Description: Using React.js and the latest frontend frameworks Annette created a dynamic Single Page Web Application.
The end result; is a full-stack personal website that uses isolated React components to highlight Annette's skills and interests. Her personal website project has laid the foundation for her understanding of the modern web and how companies are creating efficiency in deploying sites and mobile applications. Post Hackbright, she plans to deploy her site using Firebase and opensource her project for others to reuse for their own personal websites.
